# Simple2048Game
This is a simple python command line version of the 2048 game commonly found on mobile devices. The logic found in the code can further be applied to a graphical based enviroment. This is a git test.

## Install
You really just need python3 installed, but ive added a little styling to the output of the prints, so you need to install a module called pyfiglet
```bash
pip install pyfiglet
```
